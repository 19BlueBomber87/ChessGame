To celebrate obtaining the 'CLE - C Certified Entry-Level Programmer certification', I am sharing a chessboard I built in C.  

I use a triple pointer and the 'malloc' function to build a multi-dimensional array.  

The triple pointer allows the chess pieces to be longer than one character.

I use the multi-dimensional array to build a chess board.  

I use a function to print the board to the console.
